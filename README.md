# React Github resume app

This is repository for a simple react app that allows user to lookup some data from public Github API and show it to user on separate page.

## Some remarks about parts of project

### About components
As I dont have too much experience in using component libraries like Material UI so I opted to use vanilla react components for now.

### About language percentage
I wasnt quite sure how best get and calculate public data for repos language usage. I opted to show data for all public repos primary language as restricting data for ten last edited repos seems like to small of a sample and getting detailed language data for each public repo is sending excessive request to API.
